      So, what is version control?  Have you ever spent hours on a paper only to watch it disappear after your computer crashed or a button was mistakenly pushed?  This is what version control works to prevent.  It saves versions of your work as you advance through your project so not only do you have a backup if it accidentally gets deleted, but you also have the ability to revert to older versions.  The true beauty of version control shows when working on group projects.  It allows multiple people to work on the same project without stepping on each other’s toes.    Everyone can work on different parts of the task and commit changes they’ve made to the original version.  This allows everyone to have an up to date version and be on the same page at all times.

      How does git help you keep track of changes?
      Git is a form of version control.  Git works from your command line in terminal.  You use a text editor (we use sublime) to edit your code and your terminal to submit changes (using git commands) to Github.  Github is where your work is saved and merged (in cases of group projects) with your coworkers.  You can store and access your work online on GitHub, but only if you explicitly send it there via git push.  Before we can push anything however, we need to create a pathway between git and Github.  We do so by entering git init, and creating a remote via git remote add origin some_Github_URL_here.

      Why use Github to store your code?
      Github lives remotely on the Internet and is a great source to host and share your work.  It allows programmers to share their code and like we said earlier, collaborate on projects at the same time.  This is where Github really excels.  As a collaborative tool it saves time, allows for frequent feedback and suggestions which enhance the overall quality of code.
