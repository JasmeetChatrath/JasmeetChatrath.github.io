      <h3>Arrays</h3>
      <p>An array is a list of items stored between brackets [ ].  We set this list of items to the title of our array.  An example of an array is: <br>
      <code>my_array = ["I", "love", "Ruby", 5]</code> <br> You can even have an array within an array which is called a multidimensional array.  <br>
      <code>multidimensional _array = [[0, 4, 100],["five", "ten", "three"], ["red","blue","green"]]</code><br>The values in our list are assigned to numbers starting at 0.  For example, in our my_array example we would use 1 to call our “love” string.  To call that value we would enter the following code:<br>
      <code>my_array [1]</code><br>
      This is called access by index.  To call a value in out multidimensional array we use our index values as well.  To call “three” for example we would enter the following code:
      <code>multidimensional _array[1][2]</code>
     </p>
      <h3>Hash</h3>
      <p>A hash is a collection of key-value pairs. They are assigned by using "=>" and by setting it to a title.  An example of a hash follows:<br>
        <code>my_info = {
      "first_name" => "Jasmeet",
      "last_name" => "Chatrath",
      "age" => 26
        }
      </code><br>To retrieve data in our hash we use the key value.  To print “Chatrath” for example we would enter the following:<br>
      <code>puts my_info["last_name"]</code></p>
      <h3>When to use one vs the other</h3>
      <p>Ex: We would want to use an array when we have a list of items such as children’s names<br>
        <code>names = ["Jill", "Liz", "Henry", "Anna"]</code><br>
        We want to use a hash when collecting a set of key value pairs such as favorite items of each child.<br><code>favorite_items ={
  "Jill" => "book",
  "Liz" => "xbox",
  "Henry" => "car",
  "Anna" => "makeup"
}
</code></p>
