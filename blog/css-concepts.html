      <p>Inline elements respects left and right margins and padding but not top and bottom.  This element will sit on the same line without formatting it like a box (doesn't keep it's demensions so it's good for HTML that are blocks by default such as headers and paragraphs).  It only takes up as much space as it need and not the whole line.</p>
      <p>Block elements respect margins and padding. It creates a box that won't let anything sit next to it.  It takes up the whole width of the page. In other words, it forces a line break after the block element. </p>
      <p>Inline-block elements allow other elements fo sit to their left and right.  It also respects height and width and top/bottom margins and padding.  In other words, this makes the element a block box and will allow other elements to sit next to it on the same line.</p>
