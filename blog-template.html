<!--

• How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?
It was a great experience.  I ended up pairing with someone who was very vocal like myself so we learned a lot from each other.  We each had slightly different ideas of how to approach the challenge so we each worked on it and discussed the pros and cons of each way.  It was a great learning experience.

• Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?
Yes, I did find it helpful.  I am a visual person so being able to layout what I want to create made writing the HTML code very straight forward.

• What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?
We decided a good wireframe accurately represents the layout your project.  It is well organized and clear to decipher.

• What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?
I did not learn about any new semantic elements.
